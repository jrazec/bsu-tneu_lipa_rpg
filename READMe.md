## PROBLEM:
Navigating a new university campus poses a significant challenge for incoming freshmen or first-year students—specifically, in Batangas State University-TNEU Lipa Campus. The intricate maze of classrooms, offices, and facilities often becomes an intimidating obstacle in their early academic journey. The unfamiliar layout can easily overwhelm newcomers, hindering their ability to accustom and find their way around swiftly. 

Recognizing this concern, our initiative aims to tackle this challenge head-on by devising an innovative solution—the group has conceptualized and developed a game tailored to assist incoming students in navigating the campus confidently and seamlessly. Through interactive gameplay, students can explore virtual representations of classrooms, offices, and key locations, allowing them to navigate the campus virtually before stepping foot on the campus grounds. This immersive experience aims to ease the transition and equip students with a visual understanding of the campus layout, helping them feel more optimistic and prepared as they begin their academic journey.

The game is exclusively designed to benefit incoming freshmen at Batangas State University Lipa, but can also cater to students of different year levels. It is important to note that while we aim to support these specific students, our app does come with certain limitations. Time and manpower constraints have influenced the scope of our project, impacting various aspects of the app. These limitations manifest in areas such as operating system compatibility, real-time connectivity features, user experience enhancements, and the complexity of administrative controls. While we strive for a comprehensive solution, these constraints have shaped the boundaries of our current development.
